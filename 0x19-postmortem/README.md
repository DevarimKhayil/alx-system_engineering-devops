## Postmortem: Website Downtime Due to Database Overload

### Issue Summary
On June 10, 2024, from 14:00 to 16:30 EDT, our main e-commerce platform experienced a 2.5-hour outage impacting roughly 75% of our user base. During this period, users experienced slow response times and, in many cases, timeouts when attempting to access the website. The root cause was identified as an overload on our primary database server, triggered by a sudden increase in traffic due to a promotional campaign.

### Timeline
- **14:00 EDT** - Issue detected when error rates increased significantly.
- **14:05 EDT** - Initial alerts were triggered by our automated monitoring system. The engineering team was notified.
- **14:15 EDT** - The team observed unusually high read and write loads on the database. Assumed root cause was an increase in user traffic.
- **14:40 EDT** - Investigations into recent code deployments and database configuration changes did not reveal anomalies. Focus remained on traffic volume.
- **15:10 EDT** - Redirected some traffic to a secondary database to mitigate load but did not resolve the issue.
- **15:45 EDT** - Analysis showed specific queries related to the promotional campaign were not optimized and caused database locks.
- **16:00 EDT** - The decision was made to temporarily disable the campaign-specific features to alleviate the load.
- **16:20 EDT** - Normal operation levels began to resume as database loads returned to typical levels.
- **16:30 EDT** - Full service restored. Monitoring confirmed that performance was stable.

### Root Cause and Resolution
The sudden increase in traffic was due to a well-received promotional campaign. However, the specific queries involved with fetching promotional campaign data were not optimized for such high volumes, leading to excessive locking in the database. This was compounded by inadequate auto-scaling configurations for the database resources under high load conditions. The immediate fix involved disabling the problematic features of the campaign, followed by the optimization of the offending queries and adjustment of the database to handle higher loads more effectively.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent a recurrence of this issue, we have outlined the following measures:
- **Optimization of Database Queries:** All queries related to major promotional campaigns will be reviewed and optimized to handle large volumes efficiently.
- **Enhanced Database Scaling:** Implement more robust auto-scaling policies for our database servers to accommodate significant spikes in load without manual intervention.
- **Improved Monitoring and Alerts:** Enhance monitoring on database performance metrics specifically around query times and lock counts. This will ensure we can react before these metrics reach a critical point.
- **Regular Load Testing:** Conduct regular load testing of our platform, particularly prior to launching large promotional campaigns to identify potential bottlenecks.
- **Campaign Feature Flagging:** Implement feature flags for all new promotional campaigns. This allows us to disable specific features quickly if they cause unexpected load without impacting other operations.

These actions will be tracked and reviewed in our project management tools with specific tasks assigned to appropriate team members to ensure timely completion. This postmortem process and the lessons learned will be documented and included in the training material for all new engineers.
